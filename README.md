# Sales-Analysis-using-Tableau

I have done an analysis on the Sales Dataset. This Tableau dashboard provides an interactive, high-level view of company sales performance over time. It is designed to help stakeholders quickly assess key metrics, trends, regional performance, and category-wise breakdowns. The dashboard is split into multiple visual components to enable effective decision-making across various dimensions.
